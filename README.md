Reminder-Me
===========

A simple Python web service to generate RSS feeds for recurring reminders

# INSTALLATION

You just need the following:

* An ordinary CGI-enabled directory which serves up `.cgi` files as
  CGI scripts (ideally running with suexec)
* `peewee` installed (using `pip` or whatever installation mechanism
  you prefer)

To install or upgrade, just point your browser at `install.cgi`, and
then you can start making reminder feeds. That's it!
